NOTES:

The following library was written by Ulrich Drepper in 1995.  It is an
implementation of the MD5 algorithm as defined by RFC 1321.  See the
rfc1321.txt file which should have been included with this release.

It was then hacked up a bit by Gray Watson to improve code readability
(at least to me) as well as to improve its overall functionality.  The
basic algorithm is quite magic and was not touched of course.

See the md5.h header file for the function prototypes and comments.
My apologies for the minimal documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALL:

1) Typing ``make'' should be enough to build the library.

2) Typing ``make tests'' will build the md5_t test program.

3) Execute the ``md5_t'' program to run a quick set of validity tests
   on the library functions against the RFC1321 test strings.

4) You can also run the test program as ``md5_t -r filename'' to get a
   md5 signature on a file.

5) Typing ``md5_t -r -'' will generate a signature on the data read
   from standard in.

REPOSITORY:

The newest versions of the library are available on the web.
